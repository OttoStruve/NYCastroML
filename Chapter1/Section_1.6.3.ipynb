In small areas of sky it **does not matter which projection you use**, as long as the center of the projection is at center of the image! So unless you are interested in visualizing areas of the sky that get close to or exceed a radian, you are allowed to not worry about this very much.\n",

The Mercator projection was made for sailors so that they could sail at a compass setting (SWbS, say) and follow a straight line on the map. This is a very silly constraint for anyone but a sailor (and indeed, pretty silly for a sailor today), but if you have a map like this it needs to be infinitely tall; do the thought experiment of sailing, say, northwest forever, and you will see that you circmunavigate the pole in ever-tightening spirals:\n"

      "A big drawback of HEALPix is you have discretized the sphere by factors of 4 in area -- you don't have a sliding pixelization. Also, once you have done this to your data *you still need to have a projection*. This is really a way to grid your data, but then you need some piece of code to map it out for you, which is now not as simple a problem as it was before. There are situations where it is nice (most of them are spherical harmonics!), but I often find that people jump to using HEALPix 'cause the cool kids use it, even when something like a zenith-equal-area (ZEA) projection would do fine. There are lots of available codes for HEALPix, and they are totally learnable, well documented, and fast. But, like any tool (I'm looking at you, Bayes) it's not the right thing for every situation, even when you are dealing with the whole sky.\n",
